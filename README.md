**Welcome to SOLOSYNC**

HERE YOU CAN LEVEL FOR WHO YOU ARE MEANT TO BE!!!

**Arise: A Not-So-Typical To-Do App**

This project began the way many do: I was bored, watching Sung Jinwoo kick butt, and thought, "What if my to-do list felt more like that?"
So, I built this. It's my take on turning the daily grind into a grand quest.

**Live Application:** [**SOLO SYNC**](https://solo-quest-sync-1mjdu6i00-pranav-jais-projects.vercel.app/)
